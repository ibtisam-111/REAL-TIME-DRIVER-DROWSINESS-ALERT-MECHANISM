# REAL-TIME-DRIVER-DROWSINESS-ALERT-MECHANISM
we address a drowsy driver alert system that has been developed using such a technique in which the Video Stream Processing (VSP) and Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is analyzed by facial expressions concept through night vision camera and Euclidean distance of the eye and nose. Face landmark algorithm is also used as a proper way to face detection. When the driverâ€™s fatigue is detected, through camera, pulse sensor and vibration sensor the IoT module issues a warning message along with impact of collision and location information, thereby alerting with the help of alarm through the Arduino monitoring system.
