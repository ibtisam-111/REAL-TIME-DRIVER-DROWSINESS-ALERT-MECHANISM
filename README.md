# REAL-TIME-DRIVER-DROWSINESS-ALERT-MECHANISM
we address a drowsy driver alert system that has been developed using such a technique in which the Video Stream Processing (VSP) and Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is analyzed by facial expressions concept through night vision camera and Euclidean distance of the eye and nose. Face landmark algorithm is also used as a proper way to face detection. When the driver’s fatigue is detected, through camera, pulse sensor and vibration sensor the IoT module issues a warning message along with impact of collision and location information, thereby alerting with the help of alarm through the Arduino monitoring system.
 Real time driver drowsiness alert mechanism (RTDDAM) is a real time hardware-based system which provides smart solution to avoid drowsiness while driving. This system is convenient solution to keep drivers alert by taking real time decisions and prevent road accidents. So due to this system ultimately death ratio reduced due to drowsiness.
This system would be installed on driver’s vehicles and detects hypnic jerks, yawns throughout the eye glances and continuous rotation of the head to produce alert and turn the unconscious state of driver to conscious driving.

2 Problem Statement
An IoT-based system is designed to avoid countless mishaps due to drowsy drivers’ behavioral and psychological changes by focusing on driver’s facial movements. In addition to monitoring the intensity of the collisions impacts during road accidents, it is also required to keep records of the location for taking supportive action.
3 Objectives
➢ To extract real time driver fatigue features.
➢ To generate/develop alarm during driver’s drowsiness.
➢ To propose smart driver drowsiness handling module during Hypnic jerks.
➢ To maintain brief history of driver drowsiness via GSM.
➢ To merge visual and non-visual modules through Arduino Control system.
